### Project Overview
Healthy Copter is an engaging and educational game designed to promote healthy eating habits among children. Developed as part of our Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course, this game combines solid OOP principles, design patterns, and architectural frameworks to offer a robust, scalable, and maintainable codebase.

### Features
- **Engaging Gameplay:** Navigate through a kitchen with a helicopter hat, collecting nutritious items like broccoli and carrots while avoiding unhealthy treats and obstacles.

- **Educational Impact:** Teaches children the importance of healthy eating in a fun and interactive way.
- **Scalable Game Engine:** Designed to easily integrate new entities, scenes, and assets without major modifications.
- **Reusability and Modularity:** Utilizes interfaces and abstract classes to enhance code reusability across different parts of the game.
- **Robust Design:** Incorporates design patterns such as Singleton, Factory, and Strategy to manage game components like audio, collisions, and AI behavior efficiently.

### Technical Highlights
- **SOLID Principles:** Adheres strictly to SOLID principles for OOP to ensure a clean and scalable architecture.
- **Design Patterns:** Extensively uses patterns like Factory for entity and scene creation, Singleton for audio management, and Strategy for dynamic AI behavior.
- **Error Handling and Validation:** Implements advanced error handling and input validation to ensure robustness and resilience of the game engine.
- **Documentation and Organization:** Features comprehensive documentation and organized asset management to streamline development and maintenance.
